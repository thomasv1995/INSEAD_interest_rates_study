# INSEAD_interest_rates_study
This study is part of the research paper "Learning from Interest Rates: Implications for Stock-Market Efficiency" by Matthijs Breugem, Adrian Buss &amp; Joel Peress (paper: https://www.carloalberto.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BBP-LearnBondMarket-20190318.pdf). I evaluate different models for forecasting inflation in order to build multiple time series of US real interest rates that are computed using the forecasted inflation series. Furthermore, I the study the relationship between the US bond supply and real interest rates (Krishnamurthy study) to determine if bond supply is a good instrumental variable for studying the relationship between interest rates and price informativeness (a.k.a. stock market efficiency).
